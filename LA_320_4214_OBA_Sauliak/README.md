these are my notes

had difficulties with indexing the list of players. it was out of range, with set player, playertotheright and playertotheleft.
can still add players with same names, have to fix that later
also had difficulties with changing turns, had to use a temp variable to store the current player while changing the index

fixed it, next maybe a bit decorations cause it looks sooo ugly now
